**#1 Google Summer of Code (gsoc)**

*Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on introducing students to open source software development. Students work on a 3 month programming project with an open source organization during their break from university.
Since its inception in 2005, the program has brought together 14,000+ student participants and 12,000 mentors from over 125 countries worldwide. Google Summer of Code has produced 35,000,000+ lines of code for 651 open source organizations.*


**#2 Redox Summer of Code**
<h1>Becoming a Sponsor</h1>
At the moment, Redox OS has $10,800 in donations from various platforms to use to fund students. This will give us three students working for three months, if each student requests $1200 per month on average as described in Payment.

In order to fund more students, we are looking for sponsors who are willing to fund RSoC. Donations can be made on the Donate page. All donations will be used to fund Redox OS activities, with about 90% of those over the past year currently allocated to RSoC.
<h1>Becoming a Student </h1>
RSoC provides more freedom than the GSoC program. Any person can participate, on a schedule of their choosing, for the payment of their choosing.
